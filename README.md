# SwimSuite Documentation

SwimSuite is comprised of 3 services:
* Enter - For competition entries
* Race - For competition management

## Interchange
To transfer (interchange) data between services, SwimSuite uses its own, open, data format.
Documentation for the interchange formats can be found in [Interchange](Interchange/Intro.md).

## API
In order for client applications to communicate with SwimSuite, there are 2 API endpoints.
These endpoints are described in the [API Documentation](API/Intro.md).
